        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello there, I'm Charles, 34 and currently residing in London. I used to be an ESL teacher, haven lived abroad
        in places like Vietnam, Taiwan and the Czech Republic for the past couple of years, but decided to engage in a change
        of career not too long ago, so I decided to become a programmer.</p>
        <p>This website here is just a showcase for what I have been working on as well as showing my skills and how to contact me.</p>
        <p>My interests other than programming include history, 90s and 00s video games, football, travelling, languages (German, Dutch, Czech and Japanese),
            animation, archery and reading among other things. I like to work on coding projects that reflect those interests for which I have a passion for.</p>
        <p>Interesting factoid about myself: </p>
